  <h1>Efficiency in research</h1>
  <p>In my CSCE 240 class, we were often given problems that we would need to solve given certain constraints. 
    When solving these problems, the biggest issue that I would often run into was overthinking the problem. When 
    overthinking problems, it is easy to go beyond the constraints given and end up complicating the project more than necessary. 
    Usually when the solution finally became clear, I would wonder how it wasnâ€™t obvious before. While the solution could be found 
    using overcomplicated methods, they were likely not efficient or took too long to execute. It is easy to just search for a solution 
    and disregard any need for efficiency, however in the real world, it is important to consider that people will be using software and 
    it must be as efficient as possible to encourage use.</p>
  <p>My research involves using and Android Wear smartwatch to determine whether the user is smoking. Continuous monitoring is actually 
    very common in research, however the devices used are usually made special for the project. This research is novel in that it is 
    using a device that anyone can own and using it to improve lives. The problem with using a device like Android Wear is that the 
    application must run constantly, so it needs to be as efficient as possible to conserve battery life, otherwise the user might 
    quickly become frustrated with the app and not use it.</p>
  <p>The app I made for research was given to several participants to use, and I was able to meet them and demonstrate how to use it. 
    It impacted me because I got to meet people who could benefit from the work I was doing. Getting the opportunity to hear their 
    feedback on how to improve the app was very important for me. It was very important to gain critical feedback from people who would 
    actually be using the app so I could improve it for them. By thinking of the people who are affected by this project, it made me 
    realize that I need to write the program for them rather than myself. Sure, it would be great to incorporate the latest features 
    Google provides, but I need to think about whether it is necessary, or if it would exclude anyone from using it.</p>
  <p>As a supplemental instruction leader, the people I help in my sessions choose to be there. It is my job to make the best use of 
    their time. In the SI program, we create session plans for each session to have an idea of the activities we will facilitate in 
    each session. For a while, I would spend lots of time on the problems I planned on reviewing, but little time on planning for 
    activities. The sessions that would come after would sometimes end up being confusing for students since I would just throw 
    problems at them rather than focusing on how to efficiently get them to learn the concepts. While not programming-related, it 
    showed that even though I planned the content I wanted to review, the execution is what really enhances the students learning and 
    makes the sessions worth attending.</p>
  <p>These experiences allowed me to see that I might have every intention of helping others, but it is extremely important to remember 
    that I am helping them and not myself, so I need to think about the execution of my actions in a manner that would be most efficient.
    This is so important to research since it is easy to get lost in the complexity of the problems being solved and there is a race to 
    be the first to solve them, however it is important to remember the people who are impacted by the research.</p>
