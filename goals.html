  <h1>Remembering the End Goal of Research</h1>
  <!--Welcome to formatting hell-->
  <p>In research, it is pretty easy to get caught up in the technical details and lose sight of the end goal. It’s also common to get 
    lost in those details and completely miss a simple and more efficient solution. It is important in research to remember what 
    question you are trying to answer and create a replicable solution to establish the integrity of your research. In many of my 
    computer science classes, specifically CSCE 146 and CSCE 240, we learned about tools that can be used to solve problems through 
    programming and were given the opportunity to utilize them. I have also used the concepts from these classes in research to solve 
    problems while still keeping the end goal in mind. I also had to apply the general skill of remembering an end goal to my role as 
    an SI leader. These lessons and experiences have taught me the importance of keeping sight of your end goal within research.</p>
  <p>CSCE 146, or “Algorithmic Design II” was an extension to the introductory computer science course that all computer science 
    students must take. This course focused on different types of data structures within the programming language of Java. A data 
    structure is essentially something that stores values within a computer program. Knowledge of data structures is extremely 
    important because different types are beneficial for different scenarios. For example, some data structures are good for storing 
    lots of information and others are good at quickly looking up information. Essentially, this course taught me about the tools I 
    have access to as a programmer and the necessity of having concrete reasoning behind my choice of tools, as it can make a 
    difference in the outcome.</p>
  <p>My experience as a programmer grew as I took CSCE 240, or “Introduction to Software Engineering.” The professor for this course 
    often spoke of the importance of simulations, or in other words, writing programs to imitate real-life events. To drive this point 
    home, he assigned to us a project to simulate people voting and the amount of time it would take for an average person to vote 
    based on the amount of machines present. When I started working on the project, it was a mess. I was so caught up in details like 
    “how do people line up” or “how will people filter in” that I missed the whole point of the project. At one point during this 
    project, I deleted everything I had written and started fresh, since I had strayed so far from the initial goal. I mapped out what 
    I had to accomplish in this project along with how it contributed to the overall purpose and then started to program the solution. 
    When I had finished, I couldn’t believe how simple the solution was, simply because all the details were clouding my sight.</p>
  <p>The importance of knowing the purpose of your actions is not only important to the field of computer science. As an SI leader, a 
    component of our job is to write session plans that utilize a variety of activities to aid students in learning the material. For a 
    while, I would neglect focusing on choosing meaningful activities and would place all my efforts on finding problems to challenge 
    students. I realized after a while that this was entirely ineffective. I was focusing on specific examples and neglecting to ensure 
    that students understood the concept as a whole. This made me appreciate the session plan a lot more, because it made me think about 
    how the activities and problems I chose to use during sessions contributed to the overall concept, rather than getting caught up in 
    minute details and further confusing students.</p>
  <p>I have utilized these lessons in my research as I develop an application to monitor sensor data from a smartwatch to determine 
    whether the user is smoking. At every point in this project, it is important that I remember the goal of the research - to help 
    smokers. This means that every decision I make in this app must have a reason, including what data structures I use, how frequently 
    monitoring takes place, and so on. This also means that I must think of consequences that my decisions have on the end goal. For 
    example, the app must not drain the battery too much so the user is not discouraged from using it, so I need to solve this problem in 
    a way that won’t consume too much power because it would detract from the overall goal. I am reminded of my goal whenever we bring 
    participants in the lab to test the app. The most important part of the project is that they can use the app. It’s easy to get bogged 
    down by the technical details of the project, but at the end of the day, if they can’t use the app, what good is it?</p>
  <p>The lessons I have learned in the class have taught me the tools I have as a programmer and the necessity to understand how to use 
    them in the context of the end goal. I also have learned the importance of remembering the purpose of my actions and how this applies 
    to helping others through SI. These lessons helped me to have clear reasoning while programming the application for research and 
    keeping in mind the end goal and the audience I am helping. Technical details, especially within research, are often unavoidable. 
    However, it is important to not get lost within them and understand their contribution to the research as a whole.</p>
