  <p>Through my time at USC, my experiences both inside and outside the classroom have taught me the importance of focusing on goals, 
    communicating efficiently, and utilizing creativity for problem solving. All of these lessons have aided me in becoming not only a 
    better student, but also a better researcher. Because of this, I have decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at North 
    Carolina State University. In my Junior year, I served as a mentor for a high school student studying Computer Science. She ended 
    up confiding in me during our last meeting that the field was not for her for a variety of reasons, but mostly because she found it 
    boring. It is unfortunate that many students drop out of STEM fields for similar reasons, even in college. Of course, it’s 
    understandable if the field is not compatible with a student’s interests, however many don’t understand how expansive the field 
    really is. For my first year of graduate school, I will be funded as a teaching assistant. This will give me the opportunity to use 
    what I have learned at my time at USC to help students realize that Computer Science is not a dry field, but an expansive field that 
    is applicable to many different interests.</p>
  <p>In many introductory classes, there are plenty of group projects and presentations, but students often miss the purpose of them. 
    As a teaching assistant, I hope to highlight the value of these projects to students. With the projects I will assign, this will 
    help students to keep in mind the overarching goal of the assignment, or the problem that they must solve, and find a creative 
    solution to the task at hand. I hope to incorporate a good amount of communication in these projects, either by enforcing 
    communication within groups or as a presentation. These values are all extremely necessary for life after college. There is a 
    misconception that students in STEM fields do not need communication skills or are not in a creative field, when that is definitely 
    not the case. I will ensure that students understand the skills that are expected of a strong candidate in their field and teach them 
    how to improve those skills through these projects. I will know if I have succeeded based on the grades they receive on their 
    assignments and their evaluations of me in the classroom. I hope, by using these insights I have had at USC, that I can encourage 
    students to view Computer Science as an exciting field and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed after college.</p>
