  <p><i>Background</i></p>
  <p>In my time here at USC, I have found that it is necessary to be well rounded with both technical and soft skills to be successful 
    and thrive, both within and beyond the classroom. Prior to entering a STEM discipline, I had the false notion that only technical 
    skills mattered, a thought that many of my peers shared. This perception of STEM fields is problematic because it both drives 
    certain people away who would do well in the field and prevents those who are pursuing a degree in the field from building the soft 
    skills necessary for life after college. Based on the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s Statistical Analysis Report on STEM Attrition, 
    more than half of freshman in a technical major left prior to graduating. Additionally, many of those who left were high performers 
    and could have performed well in the discipline <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014001rev.pdf">(Source)</a>.</p> 
  <p><i>Suggestion</i></p>
  <p>Developing a curriculum for introductory classes that allow students to build their technical and non-technical skills in tandem.</p>
  <p><i>My Role</i></p>
  <p>I will be entering a Ph.D. program at North Carolina State University in the Fall, and will be funded as a teaching assistant for 
    computer science courses, at least for my first year. This will put me in a position to utilize what I have learned at USC to help 
    students develop the skills necessary to be successful in the STEM field, or at least appreciate them. As an SI leader, I have 
    extensive experience in developing plans around helping students learn content while utilizing various study skills such as 
    communication, collaboration, and creativity. Additionally, with practice presenting on various technical projects, I have the 
    ability to convey complex concepts in a more digestible manner so students will be able to understand them.</p>
  <p><i>My plan</i></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Assign problems with various correct answers to encourage student creativity in problem solving</li>
    <li>Encourage communication among students, both to their peers and in the form of presentations</li>
    <li>Assign a project with many components so students must understand the overarching goal</li>
  </ol>
  <p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
  <p>I will know whether my efforts were successful or if they need refining through different means of feedback. I will be able to 
    determine whether students understood the material through the grades they will receive in these assignments. I will discover 
    whether they understood the purpose of these assignments through their feedback of me as a teaching assistant. My hope is that 
    students will both learn the material for the class and understand the skills they need to demonstrate their knowledge. This 
    includes being able to communicate what they have learned so others can understand, creatively analyzing what they have learned to 
    draw complex conclusions, and utilizing this knowledge to solve a problem in an organized manner without getting lost in details.</p>
