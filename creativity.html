  <h1>Creativity in Research</h1>
  <p>Prior to being involved in research, I imagined it to be a very restricting and non-creative field, filled with long hours and 
    making obvious connections. However, I quickly learned the opposite. From the start, I was tasked with finding creative solutions 
    to problems that were happening in the real world. In my role as a Supplemental Instruction (SI) leader, I learned how to use 
    creativity to solve problems. In my classes, particularly BMEN 361, I learned about the technical aspects of the tools I would 
    eventually use to solve problems in my research. In particular, I was able to utilize the data from sensors to find creative 
    solutions to everyday problems, such as tracking smoking. I’ve learned that creativity in research means taking what is known 
    about something and viewing it from multiple perspectives to solve a problem.</p>
  <div class="w3-center">

  </div>
  <p>I first realized the importance of creativity as an SI leader. Usually, just doing problems on the board is not enough to 
    encourage students to learn the material. As a mentor, I observe a lot of math-related SI sessions and the most common comment I 
    get during our debrief when I suggest varying the session activities is that there are not enough strategies in the deck for math 
    sessions. When I started out as an SI leader, I held the same sentiment. However, as I grew more experienced with the role, I 
    realized that it wasn’t the strategies that were limited, but rather my creativity in finding applications for them. <a href="#artifact3">Since then, I 
    have been able to exercise my creativity in my session plans, where I choose a variety of activities that will help students be 
    more engaged during the session.</a> For example, rather than beginning a session with problems, I typically begin with a more 
    conceptual activity, so students can understand why the problems are relevant. Also, rather than me doing the problem on the board, 
    giving students the chance to collaborate with others in the session usually helps them grasp the concept better. It is extremely 
    important to be creative with providing material so that students are able to learn it more efficiently and be engaged with the 
    content.</p>
  <p>In BMEN 361, or “Biomedical Instrumentation,” we learned about various sensors and their use in the biomedical field. At its core, 
    a sensor is a device that can detect or measure a physical property and respond to it. This physical property can be a multitude of 
    things, whether it is light, sound waves, or even force. Learning the technical details behind how sensors work was extremely 
    interesting, especially seeing how different fields of engineering came into play for different sensors. However, when I was learning 
    about them, the sensors that we studied in this class seemed more practical in lab settings, rather than everyday experiences. I only 
    saw what application they had from a clinical perspective.</p>
  <p><a href="#wtc">One lab we did in BMEN 361 involved utilizing two sensors known as a thermistor and a piezoelectric belt to measure the 
    respiration, or breathing activity, of a participant.</a> A thermistor is placed at the nostrils and measures the temperature of the 
    air being pushed out. A piezoelectric belt is worn across the chest and measures the extent to which the chest is moving, 
    corresponding to breathing movements. We used these sensors to monitor a participant’s breathing during exercise. This lab showed 
    me how useful sensors could be. While these sensors measured breathing activity, we were able to use them to draw conclusions on 
    how the body was responding to exercise. With some creativity in experiment design and data analysis, I learned there is an 
    unlimited amount of tests that can be done to investigate problems and find potential solutions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Though BMEN 361 gave me a technical background about knowing how sensors worked, my research gave me the opportunity to understand 
    how I could be creative with them to find applications to everyday life. For my research, I use the accelerometer that is located in 
    a smartwatch to understand how a person is moving. The accelerometer essentially records how fast it is moving in different planes to 
    provide a number that can be plotted to understand the direction of movement. Admittedly, using the accelerometer to determine movement 
    for research is not unique. However, the ability to recognize gestures based on accelerometer data from a ubiquitous device is novel. 
    In most labs, special accelerometers are built or used for the particular project to gather data, however, those devices are not 
    practical in everyday life. My research aimed to obtain the same data using a smartwatch application that I would develop. With this 
    application, it would make it easier for researchers to ask smokers questions in a non-clinical setting, allowing them to feel more 
    natural versus strapping several devices on and asking questions away from typical surroundings.</p>
  <p>These experiences have shown me the importance of creativity in research, especially when solving problems. It is important to 
    have a strong foundation on how the technology works and its complexities prior to utilizing it for problem solving. Additionally, 
    knowledge of the technology allows for the creativity to be practical for the problem that is being solved. For example, while the 
    data collected from an accelerometer is useful, it is also not practical to have it running constantly, as it drains the battery of 
    the device, which would prevent use. As an SI leader, student, and researcher, I have learned about the importance of creativity in 
    many different aspects, primarily about its role in problem solving. I have also gained an appreciation for having knowledge related 
    to the problem being solved prior to being able to be creative while solving it. Whether research is being done in a clinical setting 
    or in the real world, creativity is necessary to go beyond the “surface level” of the problem and formulate a plausible for why 
    something is occurring and/or what can be done to fix it.</p>
