  <h1>Communication in research</h1>
  <p>When looking at job descriptions, “communication skills” is commonly listed. It is one of those skills many don’t realize must be trained and 
    built. Several experiences here at USC have shown me the importance of being able to communicate, especially in the field of 
    research. To most of the public, research seems to be a very closed-off profession where the researcher is enveloped in their 
    work and closed off to the outside world, when actually it is quite the opposite. Research is a very social field where you 
    must be able to communicate your findings and convince others of its merits to succeed in the field. My in-class experiences 
    with BMEN 303 and BMEN 427 helped me to understand the importance of communication within the technical field and I was able 
    to apply these skills in real-world experiences of Supplemental Instruction and research, including grant writing and 
    presenting findings.</p>
  <p>My experience in BMEN 303, or “Professional Development and Ethics in Biomedical Engineering III,” gave me a foundation for understanding 
    the importance of presenting technological information in a digestible format. <a href="#wtc">In this class, we were tasked with making 
    posters and presenting on a medical device of our choosing.</a> We were taught how to do patent searches and utilize that 
    information to learn more about our respective device. My group presented on the Fitbit. We poured over articles and patents 
    on each little component of the wearable device until we had a good grasp on how it worked at a technical level. We also were 
    given instruction on how to effectively use different mediums to present information, primarily in the form of poster 
    presentations. Prior to this class, I was not aware that posters are typically made using PowerPoint! The real challenge, 
    however, was explaining and presenting these details in a digestible form so that anyone could understand, which was our final 
    project. We took what we learned from our patent search, and described the components of a Fitbit so our audience could 
    understand how the overall device worked. This project class me gain a foundation for presenting and explaining technical 
    details oriented towards a non-technical audience. </p>
  <p>In BMEN 427, or “Senior Design for Biomedical Engineers,” my group was assigned a unique project where we were tasked with 
    working on for an entire school year. Our project, involving the diet of a Black-Footed Ferret, was very different among the 
    other projects. Additionally, we were graded on how well we explained our project, including all its technical details, during 
    various presentations. This forced me to think about this project from the eyes of someone who is not involved with it and 
    allowed me to look at things from a non-technical standpoint, as much of our audience had little experience with the 
    technology we were using.</p>

  <p>I realized how important technical communication was when I first became a Supplemental Instruction (SI) leader. This is 
    most likely the first time students’ are exposed to calculus and it is important to explain concepts in a manner that is 
    easy to understand. After I had been an SI leader for a while, I became comfortable in the position. I was taking 
    upper-level calculus classes and could appreciate calculus more fully. However, this created an extreme gap between me and 
    the students I supported. For a while I was frustrated that they were not understanding what I was trying to explain to 
    them when I realized the problem was with my communication. Looking back, I had great attendance the previous semester, 
    which was my first semester as an SI leader for Calculus I, after I had not taken it for a while. It was almost like I was 
    relearning the material with them. The semester after, I was much more familiar with the information, which potentially 
    contributed to the knowledge gap. Once I focused on communicating this information to ensure students understood it, I had 
    better attendance numbers. Every student needs a basic understanding of calculus before they can reach an appreciation for 
    it. So with that, I worked hard making the sessions more of a conversation about math, and rather than lecturing on 
    relations that they hadn’t seen before, we worked on mastering the topic at hand. This vastly improved my relationship with 
    my students and helped them succeed more in the class.</p>
  <p>In my lab, we are used to arguing over technicalities constantly and I never anticipated having to learn how to communicate 
    to a non-technical audience. When we partnered with the public health department, I realized I had to be able to give a 
    detailed account of what I was working on while making it understandable to everyone in the meeting. It was a challenge at 
    first, but as I went to more and more meetings (and had to explain shortcomings), I was able to better help them understand 
    what I was working on and the issues I would run into.</p>
  <p><a href="#artifact2">The first time it hit me how important technical communication is was when I wrote my Magellan Scholar grant.</a> This made me realize 
    that the entire field of research is dependent on talking about your research in a manner that allows others to appreciate it. 
    Especially communicating it well enough that someone is willing to fund it to make that research possible. The Magellan 
    Scholar grant had a page limit of two pages, which I found incredibly difficult to meet given the amount of details in my 
    project! However, I realized from my past experiences here at USC, that the complex details of the project are not important, 
    but conveying the importance and merit of the project are the main goals of the grant, and ensuring a general plan is in place 
    to accomplish those.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Additionally, I had the opportunity to present at the SC INBRE Summer Symposium poster presentation here at USC. This gave me 
    the opportunity to utilize the skills I learned in BMEN 303 to present this poster. Since this symposium was largely 
    biology-based, my research was stood out in comparison and I had to explain it to people who had little experience in computer 
    science. Ultimately, I had a lot of good conversations with people in the biology discipline and was able to present the 
    information in a way that they were able to understand and even provide insight on.</p>
  <p>Between the classes I have taken and my experiences outside the classroom, I realize that it is incredibly important within 
    the field of research to be able to communicate, especially in a technical field. The social nature of research requires good 
    communication skills to succeed. Communicating technical details of projects is not only necessary from convincing others of 
    the merit of your work for funding and convincing others of the importance of your findings in presentations, but also in the 
    collaborating with others to further the research being done.</p>
