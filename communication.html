  <h1>Communication in research</h1>
  <p>When looking at job descriptions, “communication skills” is usually listed among several other skills I am definitely unqualified 
  for. Several experiences here at USC have shown me the importance of being able to communicate, however, especially in the field of 
  research. To most of the public, research seems to be a very closed-off profession where the researcher is enveloped in their work 
  and closed off to the outside world, when actually it is quite the opposite. Research is a very social field where you must be able 
  to communicate your findings and convince others of its merits to succeed in the field. My in-class experiences with BMEN 303 and 
  BMEN 427 helped me to understand the importance of communication within the technical field and I was able to apply these skills in 
  real-world experiences of Supplemental Instruction and research, including grant writing and presenting findings.</p>
  <p>My experience in BMEN 303, or “Professional Development and Ethics in Biomedical Engineering III,” gave me a foundation for 
  understanding the importance of presenting technological information in a digestible format. In this class, we were tasked with 
  making posters and presenting on a medical device of our choosing. My group presented on the Fitbit. We poured over articles and 
  patents on each little component of the wearable device until we had a good grasp on how it worked at a technical level. We also were 
  given instruction on how to effectively use different mediums to present information, primarily in the form of poster presentations. 
  The real challenge, however, was explaining and presenting these details in a digestible form so that anyone could understand. This 
  project class me gain a foundation for presenting and explaining technical details oriented towards a non-technical audience.</p>
  <p>In BMEN 427, or “Senior Design for Biomedical Engineers,” my group was assigned a unique project where we were tasked with working 
  on for an entire school year. Our project, involving the diet of a Black-Footed Ferret, was very different among the other projects. 
  Additionally, we were graded on how well we explained our project, including all its technical details, during various presentations. 
  This forced me to think about this project from the eyes of someone who is not involved with it and allowed me to look at things from 
  a non-technical standpoint, as much of our audience had little experience with the technology we were using.</p>
  <p>I realized how important technical communication was when I first became a Supplemental Instruction (SI) leader. This is most 
    likely the first time students’ are exposed to calculus and it is important to explain concepts in a manner that is easy to 
    understand. After I had been an SI leader for a while, I became comfortable in the position. I was taking upper-level calculus 
    classes and could appreciate calculus more fully. However, this created an extreme gap between me and the students I supported. For 
    a while I was frustrated that they were not understanding what I was trying to explain to them when I realized the problem was with 
    my communication. Every student needs a basic understanding of calculus before they can reach an appreciation for it. So with that, 
    I worked hard making the sessions more of a conversation about math, and rather than lecturing on relations that they hadn’t seen 
    before, we worked on mastering the topic at hand. This vastly improved my relationship with my students and helped them succeed 
    more in the class.</p>
  <p>In my lab, we are used to arguing over technicalities constantly and I never anticipated having to learn how to communicate to a 
    non-technical audience. When we partnered with the public health department, I realized I had to be able to give a detailed 
    account of what I was working on while making it understandable to everyone in the meeting. It was a challenge at first, but as I 
    went to more and more meetings (and had to explain shortcomings), I was able to better help them understand what I was working on 
    and the issues I would run into.</p>
  <p>The first time it hit me how important technical communication is was when I wrote my Magellan Scholar grant. This made me 
    realize that the entire field of research is dependent on talking about your research in a manner that allows others to appreciate 
    it. Especially communicating it well enough that someone is willing to fund it to make that research possible. The Magellan Scholar 
    grant had a page limit of two pages, which I found incredibly difficult to meet given the amount of details in my project! However, 
    I realized from my past experiences here at USC, that the complex details of the project are not important, but conveying the 
    importance and merit of the project are the main goals of the grant, and ensuring a general plan is in place to accomplish those.</p>
  <p>Between the classes I have taken and my experiences outside the classroom, I realize that it is incredibly important within the 
    field of research to be able to communicate, especially in a technical field. The social nature of research requires good 
    communication skills to succeed. Communicating technical details of projects is not only necessary from convincing others of the 
    merit of your work for funding and convincing others of the importance of your findings in presentations, but also in the 
    collaborating with others to further the research being done.</p>
