  <h1>Communication in research</h1>
  <p>When looking at job descriptions, “communication skills” is usually listed among several other skills I am definitely unqualified 
  for. Several experiences here at USC have shown me the importance of being able to communicate, however, especially in the field of 
  research. To most of the public, research seems to be a very closed-off profession where the researcher is enveloped in their work 
  and closed off to the outside world, when actually it is quite the opposite. Research is a very social field where you must be able 
  to communicate your findings and convince others of its merits to succeed in the field. My in-class experiences with BMEN 303 and 
  BMEN 427 helped me to understand the importance of communication within the technical field and I was able to apply these skills in 
  real-world experiences of Supplemental Instruction and research, including grant writing and presenting findings.</p>
  <p>My experience in BMEN 303, or “Professional Development and Ethics in Biomedical Engineering III,” gave me a foundation for 
  understanding the importance of presenting technological information in a digestible format. In this class, we were tasked with 
  making posters and presenting on a medical device of our choosing. My group presented on the Fitbit. We poured over articles and 
  patents on each little component of the wearable device until we had a good grasp on how it worked at a technical level. We also were 
  given instruction on how to effectively use different mediums to present information, primarily in the form of poster presentations. 
  The real challenge, however, was explaining and presenting these details in a digestible form so that anyone could understand. This 
  project class me gain a foundation for presenting and explaining technical details oriented towards a non-technical audience.</p>
  <p>In BMEN 427, or “Senior Design for Biomedical Engineers,” my group was assigned a unique project where we were tasked with working 
  on for an entire school year. Our project, involving the diet of a Black-Footed Ferret, was very different among the other projects. 
  Additionally, we were graded on how well we explained our project, including all its technical details, during various presentations. 
  This forced me to think about this project from the eyes of someone who is not involved with it and allowed me to look at things from 
  a non-technical standpoint, as much of our audience had little experience with the technology we were using.</p>
