  <h1>Accessibility of research</h1>
  <p>Technology use is important to the field of research, but oftentimes that technology is restricted to the public, which has the 
  possibility to wall off the public from significant findings. In my research, I work closely with sensors as a broad technology. 
  Sensors are very important within the field of research and becoming increasingly important to daily life of the average person. 
  They are able to take the world around us and translate it for us to interpret. For example, if you are wearing a Fitbit, it can 
  convert acceleration data into the amount of steps you have taken, and (depending on the version), take light and convert it into a 
  heart rate, or your change in altitude and convert it into the amount of stairs you have climbed. Within the digital age and having 
  devices with various sensors, it is very easy to take advantage of them. However, with my experience in the class with BMEN 361 and 
  outside the class relying on sensors for my research, I believe sensors have an extremely important place in research and should be 
  made as accessible as possible.</p>
  <p>In BMEN 361, or “Biomedical Instrumentation,” we learned about various sensors and their use in the biomedical field. At its core, 
  a sensor is a device that can detect or measure a physical property and respond to it. This physical property can be a multitude of 
  things, whether it is fluorescent light, electromagnetic waves, or even force. Learning the technical details behind how sensors work 
  was extremely interesting, especially seeing how different fields of engineering came into play for different sensors. However, the 
  sensors that we studied in this class were more practical in lab settings, rather than everyday experiences.</p>
  <p>Though BMEN 361 gave me a technical background about knowing how sensors worked, my research gave me the opportunity to understand 
  how they can be used in everyday life. For my research, I use the accelerometer that is located in a smartwatch to understand how a 
  person is moving. The accelerometer essentially records acceleration in the x, y, and z plane to provide a number that you can plot to 
  understand the direction of movement. Using the accelerometer to determine movement for research is not unique. In most labs, special 
  accelerometers are built or used for the particular project to gather data, however, those devices are not practical in everyday life. 
  What is practical is a smartwatch that is relatively easy to afford. With this application, it would make it easier for researchers to 
  ask smokers questions in a non-clinical setting and allowing them to feel more natural versus strapping several devices onto them and 
  asking them questions while they are far from their typical surroundings.</p>
  <p>This has shown me that it is important for research to be accessible. While getting accurate results from a specialized device is 
  definitely important, information about a person’s daily life should not be kept from them. If it is possible to allow someone to 
  wear a simple device and gain much more information about the world surrounding them and what it means for them, then it should be 
  studied and provided for them.</p>
  <p>Learning about the complex nature of sensors showed me that gaining information from a physical measure is not a simple process, 
  and made me appreciate that so many sensors are immediately available to us through devices like phones and smartwatches. My research 
  showed me that it is important to use these powerful tools that are already accessible to the public and provide means for gaining 
  useful information about everyday life through them and providing them to all people, or even just making people feel less like lab 
  rats when doing research studies, therefore giving researchers more meaningful information. In a broader sense, these experiences 
  allowed me to see the importance of trying to make technology as accessible to a majority as possible.</p>
